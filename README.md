## Room for Improvement ##
- *Performance* (loading, partial rerender, select rows,...)
  - Reduce Viewstate
  - Replace ActionSupport with Javascript Remoting
  - Reduce Markup-Size
- Allow for more than 10.000 result records: For pagination I am using the `StandardSetController`, which seems to have this restriction.
- Allow to filter also for read-only fields in FilterBuilder without loosing the context-sensitive input fields.
- Optionally replace pagination with Infinite Scroll.
- Solve Bugs:
  - FilterBuilder does not clear value field when switching field
  - Save/Delete selected buttons are not activated when checkbox is selected
  - ...
